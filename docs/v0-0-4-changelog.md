This version includes a simpler UI which only shows one action at a time. You can open the popup and view only the action you can take on that page which is either Copy or Paste. 

This update also includes...

1. A bug fix for the Video element.
2. Recommendations feature (this will explain what was not copied and why)

Thanks for testing it out!
