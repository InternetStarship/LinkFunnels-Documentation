# Changelog v0.0.3

For this release, we have focused on improving the user experience by providing a screen that blocks the Copy and Paste buttons if you are not on a ClickFunnels v1 or v2 page. 

This update also fixed a bug with the button that was causing the page to crash. 

Each update will come with a small changelog.
